Commit your changes with clear, descriptive messages:\n   ```bash\n   git commit -m "Add user authentication feature"\n   ```\n\n4. Push your branch to your fork:\n   ```bash\n   git push origin feature/your-feature-name\n   ```\n\n5. Create a pull request from your fork to the main repository\n\n## Coding Standards\n\n### General Guidelines\n- Write clean, readable, and maintainable code\n- Follow existing code style and patterns in the project\n- Include comments for complex logic\n- Keep functions and methods focused and concise\n- Use meaningful variable and function names\n\n### Code Quality\n- Ensure your code passes all existing tests\n- Add tests for new functionality\n- Remove any debugging code or console logs before committing\n- Handle errors appropriately\n- Follow security best practices\n\n### Documentation\n- Update documentation for any new features or changes\n- Include inline code comments where necessary\n- Update README if your changes affect setup or usage\n- Write clear commit messages and pull request descriptions\n\n## Pull Request Process\n\n### Before Submitting\n- [ ] Ensure your code follows the project\'s coding standards\n- [ ] Run all tests and ensure they pass\n- [ ] Update documentation as needed\n- [ ] Rebase your branch on the latest main branch\n- [ ] Ensure your branch has a clear, focused purpose\n\n### Pull Request Guidelines\n1. **Title**: Use a clear, descriptive title\n2. **Description**: Provide a detailed description of your changes\n3. **Link Issues**: Reference any related issues using `#issue-number`\n4. **Testing**: Describe how you tested your changes\n5. **Screenshots**: Include screenshots for UI changes\n\n### Review Process\n- All pull requests require review before merging\n- Address any feedback from reviewers promptly\n- Be open to suggestions and willing to make changes\n- Maintain a respectful and collaborative tone in discussions\n\n## Issue Reporting\n\n### Bug Reports\nWhen reporting bugs, please include:\n- Clear description of the issue\n- Steps to reproduce the problem\n- Expected vs. actual behavior\n- Environment details (OS, browser, version, etc.)\n- Screenshots or error messages if applicable\n\n### Feature Requests\nFor feature requests, please provide:\n- Clear description of the proposed feature\n- Use case and justification\n- Possible implementation approach\n- Any relevant examples or mockups\n\n## Communication Guidelines\n\n### Code of Conduct\n- Be respectful and inclusive\n- Welcome newcomers and help them get started\n- Focus on constructive feedback\n- Respect different opinions and approaches\n- Follow the project\'s code of conduct if one exists\n\n### Getting Help\n- Check existing documentation first\n- Search through existing issues and discussions' additional_kwargs={} response_metadata={'id': 'msg_01A4BTm8VfuTcN9Qg327bxbR', 'model': 'claude-sonnet-4-20250514', 'stop_reason': 'max_tokens', 'stop_sequence': None, 'usage': {'cache_creation_input_tokens': 0, 'cache_read_input_tokens': 0, 'input_tokens': 105, 'output_tokens': 1024, 'cache_creation': {'ephemeral_5m_input_tokens': 0, 'ephemeral_1h_input_tokens': 0}, 'service_tier': 'standard'}} id='run--aa0197ee-ad31-434a-88b3-aa5fd6aab095-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 105, 'output_tokens': 1024, 'total_tokens': 1129, 'input_token_details': {'cache_read': 0, 'cache_creation': 0}}
